Personally I'm pretty conflicted about the role of AI tools in game development, but I'm not going to ignore what's happening. This interactive demo for developers to try the new text-to-speech model in the OpenAI API kind of blew me away when I took a look. 

While I don't think an ai tool is an ethical or worthy replacement for a human performace, as a solo dev without a budget I could see this as a useful tool for protoyping ideas.
