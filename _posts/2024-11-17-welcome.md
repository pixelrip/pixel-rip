Not to be overly dramatic or anything, but video games might just be the pinnacle of human creativity—nay, the ultimate form of ART.

To make a good video game you’ve got to be a visual artist, software developer, sound designer, musician, songwriter, interface designer, graphics designer, gameplay designer, storyteller, salesperson, marketer, and about a dozen other things. It’s obscene, really.

[Great games](https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-dc) happen because of [amazing teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojima_Productions). [Doing it solo](https://www.stardewvalley.net)? That's [legendary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Barone). The whole process is almost too much to grok. 

But why not try?

PIXELRIP was born out of a deep love for everything that goes in making video games: [art](/tags/art/), [dev](/tags/dev/), [music](/tags/music/), [gameplay](/tags/gameplay/), [writing](/tags/writing/), and [those dozens of other things](/all/) that make a game come to life.

This site is here to document a personal journey into game design (warts and all) in the hope that someone out there may find it a little bit useful as they embark on their own journey. 

Welcome!
