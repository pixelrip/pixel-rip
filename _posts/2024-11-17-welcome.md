PIXELRIP was born out of a deep love for everything that goes in making video games: [art](/tags/art/), [dev](/tags/dev/), [music](/tags/music/), [gameplay](/tags/gameplay/), [writing](/tags/writing/), and [those dozens of other things](/all/) that make a game come to life.

This site is here to document a personal journey into game design (warts and all) in the hope that someone out there may find it a little bit useful as they embark on their own journey. 

Welcome!
